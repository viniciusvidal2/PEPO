# PEPO
This is a repository for the 3D Scanner called PEPO, developed for the Project "Virtual". It is composed of an embedded NVidia Jetson Nano board, a Livox MID-40 lidar sensor, a Full HD Logitech USB camera, Dynamixel servo motors and a wireless router, everything meant to reconstruct objects and the whole environment around it!

This repository is dedicated to the Fog node of the architecture, so everything is developed for a regular laptop running Ubuntu 16 and ROS Kinetic. If you are interested in the Edge node environment (embedded), take a look in our [EDGE repository](https://github.com/viniciusvidal2/PEPO_Embarcado).

Check out a picture of the first prototype developed by Antonio, a member of our team.
